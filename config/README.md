## Fish
**fish is a Unix shell with a focus on interactivity and usability**. Fish is designed to give the user features by default, rather than by configuration. Fish is considered an exotic shell since it does not adhere to POSIX shell standards, at the discretion of the maintainers. [_Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_(Unix_shell))

## Neovim
**Neovim is a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the tradition of Vim** (which itself derives from Stevie). It is not a rewrite but a continuation and extension of Vim. Many clones and derivatives exist, some very clever—but none are Vim. **Neovim is built for users who want the good parts of Vim, and more.** [_Neovim_](https://neovim.io/charter/)
